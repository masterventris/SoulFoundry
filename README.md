# SoulFoundry

> "Souls. Powerful things. Capable of giving life to otherwise inanimate objects, souls are the manifestation of "being". Intelligence, memories, emotions. Yet when the host dies, we just allow this energy to escape. Gone, into the void. If only we could harness that power after death. After all, the original owner is dead, they aren't going to complain. Might as well put the dead slaves back to work..."
